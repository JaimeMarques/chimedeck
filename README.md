## Documentation

- [Features and GIF Demos](FEATURES.md)

## Application Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) ≥ 1.3.5
- Docker + Docker Compose

### Quick start (local dev — no Redis required)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bun install

# 2. Copy environment config and edit as needed
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Build + start Postgres (pg_cron image built on first run, ~20 s) + LocalStack S3
docker compose up -d postgres localstack

# 4. Run database migrations
bun run db:migrate

# Optionally, when you have the seeds file to test
# Put this files in db/all_trello_cards.json
bun run db:seed:trello 

# 5. Start the dev server (hot-reload)
bun run dev:local
```

> `curl http://localhost:3000/health` → `{ "status": "ok" }`

### With Redis (full stack)

```bash
docker compose --profile redis up -d
```

Set `FLAG_USE_REDIS=true` (or remove the flag) in `.env` to enable the Redis adapter.

### Feature Flags

Feature flags are resolved from multiple sources (lowest → highest priority):

1. Hardcoded defaults (`server/mods/flags/defaults.ts`)
2. JSON file (`FEATURE_FLAGS_JSON_PATH=/config/flags.json`)
3. Environment variables (`FLAG_<KEY>=true|false`)
4. Remote provider (Flagsmith / FeatBit — configured via `FEATURE_FLAGS_PROVIDER`)

```bash
# Run without Redis
FLAG_USE_REDIS=false bun run dev

# Run without virus scanning
FLAG_VIRUS_SCAN_ENABLED=false bun run dev

# Use Bun Worker scheduler instead of pg_cron (default for local dev)
AUTOMATION_USE_PGCRON=false bun run dev
```

### Available scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `bun run dev` | Start with hot-reload |
| `bun run start` | Start production server |
| `bun run build` | Build client (Vite) + typecheck server |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `bun run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `bun run db:migrate` | Run database migrations |
| `bun run db:seed:trello` | Seed database from Trello export |
| `bun test` | Run all tests |
| `bun run docker:build` | Build the production Docker image |
| `bun run docker:prod` | Run the production image via docker-compose |

### Running production mode locally

**Option A — native Bun (no Docker):**

```bash
# Build Vite client bundle + typecheck
bun run build

# Start server in production mode
bun run start
```

**Option B — Docker (closest to real production):**

```bash
# Build the production image (multi-stage: deps → build → runtime)
bun run docker:build

# Run with the prod compose file (uses .env for config)
bun run docker:prod
```

> Make sure `.env` contains all required variables (see `.env.example`) before running either option.

---

## Production Build & Deployment

The production image is a single self-contained Docker container (Vite client bundle + Bun server). External services — Postgres (RDS) and S3 — are referenced by URL via environment variables; nothing is co-located with the app container.

### What the Docker build does

1. **Stage 1 — deps**: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
2. **Stage 2 — build**: `bun run build:client`
3. **Stage 3 — runtime**: copies `node_modules`, `server/`, `db/`, `dist/`, and `entrypoint.sh` into a minimal Alpine image; runs as a non-root user

### CI pipeline (build & push to ECR)

```bash
# Authenticate to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

# Build — typecheck + Vite bundle happen inside the multi-stage Dockerfile
docker build -t chimedeck-app:${IMAGE_TAG} .

# Tag and push
docker tag chimedeck-app:${IMAGE_TAG} <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/chimedeck-app:${IMAGE_TAG}
docker push <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/chimedeck-app:${IMAGE_TAG}
```

### CD pipeline (host machine)

The host only needs two files — **no source code required**:

| File | How it gets there |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | `scp`'d once, or kept in a separate deploy repo |
| `.env.production` | Created manually on the host (contains secrets — never commit this) |

`docker-compose.prod.yml` references the ECR image by name/tag via `image: "${DOCKER_IMAGE}:${IMAGE_TAG}"`. Compose pulls it from ECR and starts it — no build step on the host.

```bash
# 1. Authenticate to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> \
  | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

# 2. Run database migrations (one-off container — Compose pulls the image here)
docker run --rm --env-file .env.production \
  <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/chimedeck-app:${IMAGE_TAG} \
  bun run db:migrate

# 3. (One-time, local-db profile only) Activate pg_cron after the first migration
#    Skip this step when using external RDS — configure pg_cron there separately.
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile local-db exec postgres \
  psql -U "${POSTGRES_USER}" -d "${POSTGRES_DB}" \
  -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;" \
  -c "SELECT cron.schedule('automation-tick','* * * * *',\$\$SELECT automation_scheduler_tick()\$\$);"

# 4. Start the app (Compose reuses the already-pulled image)
#
# Default — external RDS + S3 (AWS managed):
DOCKER_IMAGE=<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/chimedeck-app \
IMAGE_TAG=${IMAGE_TAG} \
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# With internal Postgres instead of RDS (builds Dockerfile.postgres on first run, ~20 s):
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile local-db up -d

# With LocalStack instead of AWS S3:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile local-s3 up -d

# With Redis sidecar:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile redis up -d

# Combining profiles:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile local-db --profile local-s3 --profile redis up -d
```

### Managed-service EC2 rollout

For an EC2 fleet behind a load balancer, run `scripts/deploy-on-instance.sh` **one host at a time** through a controlled remote-execution channel such as SSM. It uses managed services by default; it does not start local Postgres, LocalStack or Redis.

```bash
IMAGE_URL=<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/chimedeck-app:<immutable-tag> \
AWS_REGION=<region> \
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.prod.yml \
RUN_MIGRATIONS=false \
bash scripts/deploy-on-instance.sh
```

- The script logs in to the registry host derived from `IMAGE_URL`, pulls and force-recreates only the app container, then requires consecutive local `/health` successes.
- `RUN_MIGRATIONS=true` runs `bun run db:migrate:safe` before rollout. Run that phase once, not once per host.
- Trello seeding is rejected by the deployment script. Run `bun run db:seed:trello` only as an explicitly approved one-off operation.
- If the new image fails health checks, the script restores the prior image and exits non-zero. Verify load-balancer target health before moving to the next host.

> The app connects to **AWS RDS** via `DATABASE_URL` and to **AWS S3** via `S3_BUCKET` / `AWS_*` credentials — no database or S3 container runs on the host.

### Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.production` on the host and fill in all values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
```

Key production-only variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Full Postgres connection string (e.g. RDS endpoint) |
| `S3_BUCKET` | AWS S3 bucket name |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM credentials for S3 |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region |

#### Sentry (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SENTRY_SERVER_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Sentry capture on the Bun server |
| `SENTRY_SERVER_DSN` | _(empty)_ | Sentry DSN for the server — obtain from your Sentry project settings |
| `VITE_SENTRY_CLIENT_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Sentry capture in the React client |
| `VITE_SENTRY_CLIENT_DSN` | _(empty)_ | Sentry DSN for the client |
| `SENTRY_ENV` / `VITE_SENTRY_ENV` | `development` | Deployment environment tag sent to Sentry — must match on both client and server for source-map lookup to work (e.g. `production`, `staging`) |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` / `VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE` | _(empty)_ | Release identifier (git SHA or semver tag). Must be identical to the value used during `build:deploy` for source-map correlation |
| `VITE_SENTRY_REPLAY_ENABLED` | `false` | Opt-in Session Replay for the React client (bandwidth-intensive) |

Both `*_ENABLED` flags must be `true` **and** the corresponding `*_DSN` must be non-empty for Sentry to initialise. Omitting or leaving either blank is safe — the app starts normally without capture.

#### Sentry privacy defaults

Sentry is configured with strict privacy defaults that apply automatically — no extra setup required:

| Protection | Default |
|---|---|
| Auto-PII collection | **Disabled** (`sendDefaultPii: false`) |
| Authorization / Cookie headers | Redacted to `[redacted]` by `beforeSend` |
| Sensitive URL query-params (`token`, `access_token`, `password`, `secret`, …) | Redacted to `[redacted]` by `beforeSend` |
| Request body credentials (`password`, `token`, `credit_card`, …) | Redacted server-side by `beforeSend` |
| Session Replay text / media | Fully masked (`maskAllText`, `blockAllMedia`) |

> **Override caveat:** if you call `captureMessage` or `captureError` with manually constructed strings that include PII, the automatic redaction will not save you. Always sanitize data before passing it to Sentry helpers.

#### Sentry source map upload (deploy builds only)

Source maps are generated on every build (`vite build`). The Sentry Vite plugin uploads them to Sentry and then **deletes the `.map` files** from `dist/` so they are never served publicly.

The upload is gated: it only runs when **all three** of the following env vars are present at build time:

| Build-time variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Sentry API auth token with `project:releases` scope |
| `SENTRY_ORG` | Your Sentry organisation slug |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT` | Your Sentry project slug |

When any of these is absent (e.g. in local dev or plain CI runs) the plugin is omitted entirely — no network calls are made and no `.map` files are deleted.

**Deploy build command** (CI/CD pipeline):

```bash
# SENTRY_RELEASE is derived from the git SHA automatically if not set explicitly
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> \
SENTRY_ORG=<org> \
SENTRY_PROJECT=<project> \
SENTRY_RELEASE=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  bun run build:deploy
```

`build:deploy` is equivalent to `build` but pre-seeds `SENTRY_RELEASE` from the current git SHA so the runtime SDK and the source-map upload always use the same identifier.

> **Local dev**: run `bun run build:client` or `bun run dev` as usual — no upload, no token required.

#### Sentry client bootstrap

The React client initialises Sentry in `src/main.tsx` via `initSentry()` (defined in `src/common/monitoring/sentryClient.ts`).  
Initialisation is guarded — Sentry is a no-op when `VITE_SENTRY_CLIENT_ENABLED` is `false` or `VITE_SENTRY_CLIENT_DSN` is empty.

**Manual smoke test checklist:**

1. Set `VITE_SENTRY_CLIENT_ENABLED=true` and a valid `VITE_SENTRY_CLIENT_DSN` in `.env`.
2. Start the dev server: `bun run dev`.
3. Trigger a client error (e.g., open the browser console and run `throw new Error('test')`).
4. Confirm the event appears in your Sentry project dashboard.
5. Set `VITE_SENTRY_CLIENT_ENABLED=false`, restart, and confirm **no** Sentry network requests are made (check the Network tab).

See `src/common/monitoring/README.md` for full usage and privacy guidance.

### Feature flags at startup

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SEED_TRELLO` | `false` | Runs `bun run db:seed:trello` before the server starts |
| `AUTOMATION_USE_PGCRON` | `false` | `true` enables pg_cron scheduling; `false` uses Bun Worker (setInterval) fallback — the fallback does not survive restarts so use `true` in production |

Set `SEED_TRELLO=true` in `.env.production` for the first deployment to import Trello data, then set it back to `false`.

## Agent Loop (Agentic Boilerplate)

A GitHub Copilot agent loop for building Sharetribe Horizon extensions iteratively.
Each run cycles through **Recap → Planning → Execute → Retest → Changelog** with mandatory test creation for new flows and changelog documentation for all edits.

---

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli) installed and authenticated (`gh copilot --version`)
- Git with SSH access to the JourneyHorizon GitHub org
- `bash` 4+

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1 — Fill in your project requirements

Open [`specs/architecture/requirements.md`](specs/architecture/requirements.md) and replace every `(fill in)` placeholder with real content:

- **Project Name** — what the project is called
- **Description** — what it does and who it's for
- **Key Features** — the main features to build, one per line
- **External Integrations** — third-party services (Stripe, Voucherify, etc.)
- **Constraints** — non-negotiables (tech stack, legal, performance, timeline)
- **Open Questions** — anything the architect should flag before writing code

This file is the agent's primary source of intent. The more detail you provide, the better the generated architecture will be.

> ⚠️ `setup.sh` will refuse to run until all `(fill in)` placeholders have been replaced.

### Step 2 — Run setup (once only)

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This validates your requirements file, then clones the Sharetribe web template into `./sample-project/` as a **read-only reference repository**.  
The agent will consult it during every Recap and Planning phase to understand upstream patterns — it is never modified.

> ⚠️ Only run `setup.sh` once. Re-running it is safe (the clone step is skipped if the directory already exists), but there is no reason to run it again after the initial setup.

### Step 3 — Run the agent loop

```bash
bash start-agent-loop.sh "Your task description here"
```

Write a clear, one-sentence task description as the first argument.

Example:

```bash
bash start-agent-loop.sh "Implement the Voucher discount feature with Voucherify integration"
```

The loop runs up to **10 iterations** by default. Each iteration:

| Phase | Model | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Recap** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Reads specs, changelogs, and the reference repo; summarises current state |
| **Planning** | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Produces a scoped, numbered implementation plan (≤ 2 features per iter) |
| **Execute** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Implements exactly what was planned — no scope creep; **creates test scenarios for new flows** |
| **Retest** | Haiku 4.5 + GPT-4.1 | Scout decides if Playwright MCP testing is needed; evaluator runs it if so; **runs new test scenarios** |
| **Changelog** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | **Mandatory** — writes `specs/changelog/<timestamp>.md` with Update / New / Technical Debt / Next |

**Mandatory requirements:**
- Every new user-facing flow or API endpoint must have a test scenario in `specs/tests/`
- Every iteration must produce a changelog in `specs/changelog/`

The loop exits early when the agent signals all tasks are complete.

---

## E2E Testing

The agent's Retest phase (and you manually) can run end-to-end scenarios against a live dev server using the **Playwright MCP server**.

### Step 1 — Start the Playwright MCP server

In a dedicated terminal, run:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```

Keep this terminal open while tests are running. The server listens on `http://localhost:8931` and gives GitHub Copilot full browser-automation capabilities via MCP.

### Step 2 — Start your dev server

Make sure the application is running at the `BASE_URL` expected by the tests (default `http://localhost:5173`).

### Step 3 — Run the tests

Run a single scenario:

```bash
./run-test.sh specs/tests/<scenario>.md
```

Run all scenarios:

```bash
./run-all-tests.sh
```

### Writing test cases

Every developed feature **must** have a corresponding test scenario file in `specs/tests/` in Markdown format.  
See [specs/tests/homepage-load.md](specs/tests/homepage-load.md) as a reference example.

## Specs

### Requirements (`specs/architecture/requirements.md`)

The starting point for the entire project. **Fill this in before running `setup.sh`.** The agent reads it on every Recap and Planning phase as the authoritative source of what needs to be built. Every architectural decision is traced back to a requirement here.

### Architecture specs (`specs/architecture/`)

Place Markdown files here describing the intended system design, constraints, and architectural decisions. The agent reads all `.md` files in this folder during every Recap and Planning phase and must align its plan with what is documented.

### Test scenarios (`specs/tests/`)

**Mandatory for new flows** — Every feature that has been developed **must** have a corresponding `.md` test scenario file here. The agent writes and runs these during the Retest phase; you can also run them manually with `run-test.sh` / `run-all-tests.sh`. Use [specs/tests/homepage-load.md](specs/tests/homepage-load.md) as a starting template.

**Phase 3 (Execute)** requires creating test scenarios for every new user-facing flow or API endpoint, and **Phase 4 (Retest)** verifies they pass.

### Changelogs (`specs/changelog/`)

**Mandatory** — Auto-generated by the agent after every iteration. Each file is named `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` and contains:

- **Update** — changes made to existing code or features
- **New** — newly added features, files, or capabilities (including test scenarios)
- **Technical Debt** — shortcuts taken or issues to revisit
- **What Should Be Done Next** — deferred items and recommended follow-up tasks

Do not edit these files manually; they serve as the agent's institutional memory across iterations. **Phase 5 (Changelog) can never be skipped** — every iteration must produce a changelog entry.

---

## Configuration

Open `start-agent-loop.sh` and adjust the variables at the top if needed:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_ITERATIONS` | `10` | Maximum number of Recap→Execute cycles |
| `SAMPLE_PROJECT_DIR` | `sample-project` | Path to the read-only reference repo |
| `CHANGELOG_DIR` | `specs/changelog` | Where timestamped changelogs are written |
| `MODEL_RECAP` | `gpt-4.1` | Model for Recap phase |
| `MODEL_PLAN` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Model for Planning phase |
| `MODEL_EXECUTE` | `gpt-4.1` | Model for Execute phase |
| `MODEL_TEST_FREE` | `gpt-4.1` | Model for Retest scout pass |
| `MODEL_TEST_EVAL` | `gpt-4.1` | Model for Playwright MCP evaluation |

---

## Coding Conventions

All conventions are embedded in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and are enforced automatically by the agent. They cover:

- **Feature-grouped folder structure** for both client (`src/extensions/`) and server (`server/extensions/`) code
- **API endpoint** method usage, naming, error shape, and response shapes
- **Code module** priorities, noun-based naming, single-object input/output, functional composition
- **Security** — deny-first auth, single identity provider, config-module env access

Refer to [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for the full reference.

## Final Words from a Human (the creator)

So just before we end this...this is a real human message (above are all AI-ish messages) (._.!)

The projects would obviously have lots of improvement and lots of sh*t codes... Because you know why *ahem*... ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و

It would be great if you guys can help contributing to the project and let me know if there are things that needed to be improved on, it's impossible to catch all the things the AI written out. ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ

Hope that this would serve as a good boilerplate so everyone can reduce the cost SaaS trying to charge... ▄︻デ══━一💥

All that money spent... and I could have bought multiple CR7 auto trading card with that if those money were to divide into bonus .·°՞(っ-ᯅ-ς)՞°·.

I think this message will slip out unnotice...my boss will not see this (≖⩊≖) as I add them in the last section where nobody read (ㅅ´ ˘ `)

SIUUU~~

Godspeed everyone.
